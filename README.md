# HackMIT-2020

The main purpose of the project is to provide the user with the least crowded destination that would still satisfy the user’s needs. Scientific studies have shown that social distancing is an extremely effective way to stop the spread of the COVID-19. However, many still do not have access to empirical data to rely on in order to determine which location is the least crowded and easiest to social distance. Most software technologies that have been developed during the coronavirus pandemic have provided information about contact tracing once people are known to have contracted the virus. Our goal is to proactively prevent the spread by enabling users to make informed decisions in order to socially distance in their daily lives.

CoroNavigator analyzes hourly foot traffic data of all major POIs (Points of Interest) and visualizes the results to the user in an interactive, intuitive website. In addition, once the user inputs what kind of location they want to visit, CoroNavigator uses a time series machine learning algorithm to predict the traffic in POIs in the next few hours and recommends the least crowded location that is nearby the user’s current location.
